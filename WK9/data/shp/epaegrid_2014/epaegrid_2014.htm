<strong><b>GENERAL DESCRIPTION:</b></strong>
<table width="650">
<tr>
<td>
The Emissions &amp; Generation Resource Integrated Database (eGRID) is a comprehensive inventory of environmental attributes of electric power systems. The preeminent source of air emissions data for the electric power sector, eGRID is based on available plant-specific data for all State of Florida electricity generating plants that provide power to the electric grid and report data to the U.S. government. eGRID contains air emissions data for nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide, and mercury.  The information includes fuel consumption, generation, and emissions data, along with plant identification, location, and structural information for nearly all electric generators in the State of Florida.  Please note: The EPA has recently changed the naming convention of eGRID. The current edition is named with a year corresponding to the year of the data (eGRID2014), while the publication year of the data is 2017. Those changes are reflected in the Title above. For more information on eGRID please see the following EPA documentation: https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2017-01/documents/egrid_technicalsupportdocument_0.pdf. This is an update to the FGDL layer EPAEGRID_2012.shp.

eGRID

The Emissions &amp; Generation Resource Integrated Database (eGRID) is 
a comprehensive source of data on the environmental characteristics of 
almost all electric power generated in the United States. These environmental 
characteristics include air emissions for nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, 
carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide; emissions rates; net generation; 
resource mix; and many other attributes.

eGRID2014 is the eleventh edition of eGRID, which contains the 
complete release of year 2014 data.

eGRID2014, released in January 2017, is the eleventh edition of eGRID. 
eGRID2014 includes two Excel workbooks, one with English units and 
one with metric units, that contain spreadsheets by aggregation level for 
data year 2014: generator, unit, plant, state, balancing authority, eGRID 
subregion, NERC region, and United States. The workbooks also include 
a spreadsheet that displays the grid gross loss and the variables that are 
used in its estimation for year 2014.

A Technical Support Document describes the sources and uses of data, the 
methodologies used for estimating emissions, changes from previous editions, all 
data elements (in the file structure), and other information. Summary Tables of 
select eGRID data are also provided.

The following new files are available on the eGRID web site -- epa.gov/energy/egrid :

eGRID2014_data.zip contains all files initially released for eGRID2014 including 
operational data for year 2014:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is eGRID?
The Emissions &amp; Generation Resource Integrated Database (eGRID) is a comprehensive 
inventory of environmental attributes of electric power systems. The preeminent source 
of air emission data for the electric power sector, eGRID is based on available plant-specific 
data for all U.S. electricity generating plants that provide power to the electric grid and report 
data to the U.S. government. eGRID uses data from the Energy Information Administration 
(EIA) Forms EIA-860 and EIA-923 and EPA s Clean Air Markets Program Data. Emission 
data from EPA are carefully integrated with generation data from EIA to produce useful 
values like pounds of emissions per megawatt-hour of electricity generation (lb/MWh), 
which allows direct comparison of the environmental attributes of electricity generation. 
eGRID also provides aggregated data by state, U.S. total, and by three different sets of 
electric grid boundaries (i.e., balancing authority area, NERC region, and eGRID subregion).

Why eGRID?
Many consumers now have a choice regarding the source of their electricity, and 
some seek cleaner sources, such as wind and solar power. EPA s Power Profiler 
application, which uses eGRID data, helps individual consumers to understand the 
environmental impacts of their own electricity usage. Electricity generation is the 
dominant industrial source of air emissions in the United States today. Whenever you 
switch on an electrical appliance, chances are you are contributing to air pollution 
and greenhouse gas emissions. By documenting the environmental attributes of electric 
power generation, eGRID can help consumers and researchers to better understand 
the relationship between electricity and the environment.

In the United States, electricity is generated in many different ways, with a wide variation 
in environmental impacts. In many states, power companies are required to disclose 
the environmental attributes of their retail electricity products. eGRID data can be used 
to support the following activities:
     
     * Greenhouse gas registries and inventories;
     * Carbon footprinting; 
     * Consumer information disclosure;
     * Renewable portfolio standards;
     * Development of emissions inventories and emission standards;
     * Analysis of changing power markets; and
     * Estimation of avoided emissions.<br /><br />

Summary of eGRID2014 Data

2.1 eGRID Files

eGRID2014 contains electric power data at different levels of aggregation. The eGRID2014 data are
displayed in two workbooks, one with English units of measure and the other with metric units of
measure. As the database name implies, the focus of the data spreadsheets is on two areas: generation
and emissions. In the English unit workbook, generation is expressed in both MWh and as a
percentage (called "resource mix" - generation of a certain fuel or resource type divided by total
generation). Carbon dioxide, NOx, and SO2 emissions are expressed in short tons; CH4, and N2O
emissions are expressed in pounds; emission rates for CO2, NOx, and SO2 are expressed in lb/MWh
and lb/MMBtu; and emission rates for CH4, and N2O are expressed in lb/GWh and lb/GBtu. In the
Metric unit workbook, generation is expressed in MWh, Gigajoules (GJ), and as a percentage. Carbon
dioxide, NOx, and SO2 emissions are expressed in metric tons; CH4, and N2O emissions are expressed
in kilograms; emission rates for CO2, NOx, and SO2 are expressed in both kg/MWh and kg/GJ; and
emission rates for CH4, and N2O are expressed in both kg/GWh and kg/TJ. See Table C-7 for a list of
English to Metric conversion factors.

The eGRID2014 workbooks can be downloaded from the EPA eGRID website,
https://www.epa.gov/energy/egrid, along with Summary Tables and this document. The workbooks
contain eight levels of data aggregation:
     
     *UNIT (unit), with 23,428 records;
     *GEN (generator), with 24,439 records;
     *PLNT (plant), with 8,503 records;
     *ST (state), with 51 records;
     *BA (balancing authority), with 73 records;
     *SRL (eGRID subregion), with 26 records;
     *NRL (NERC region), with 10 records; and
     *US, with 1 record.

The unit spreadsheet is sorted by state abbreviation, plant name, plant code, and boiler ID. The
generator spreadsheet is sorted by state abbreviation, plant name, plant code, and generator ID. The
plant spreadsheet is sorted by state abbreviation, plant name, and plant code. The state spreadsheet is
sorted by state abbreviation, the balancing authority spreadsheet is sorted by balancing authority
name, the eGRID subregion spreadsheet is sorted by eGRID subregion name, and the NERC region
spreadsheet is sorted by NERC region acronym. The year 2014 grid gross loss spreadsheet is also
included in the workbook.

The spreadsheet structure for each of the spreadsheets is included in Appendix A. The spreadsheet
structure also includes a description of the variables and the original data sources.
Users should take note that eGRID s emissions and emission rates are calculated at the sources of
generation and do not account for losses from transmission and distribution infrastructures. Please 
refer to Section 3.5 for information on how to account for line losses when assigning emission rates to
estimate indirect emissions associated with electricity purchases. Aggregated eGRID data only
account for U.S. generation that takes place within the aggregated area and do not account for any
electricity that is imported from or exported to other areas. The grid gross loss calculation, however,
does account for U.S. regional interchanges with other U.S. regions as well as Canada and Mexico.
In addition, although eGRID is based on existing Federal data sources, its development requires
substantial attention to quality control. Accurate matching of entities from different databases requires
great care, even where identification codes are available. Inconsistencies between data sources,
missing data, and ambiguous data necessitate adjustments to values of individual data elements,
especially identification data. In general, however, questionable data are not altered in order to
maintain consistency with the original data sources.

Please note that only certain eGRID spreadsheets can be linked from year 2014 to years 2012, 2010,
2009, 2007, 2005, or 2004. The spreadsheets that can be linked include the NERC region (by NERC
acronym), eGRID subregion (by eGRID subregion acronym), state (by state abbreviation), plant (by
Office of Regulatory Information Systems Plant [ORISPL] code), and the US.

2.2 What s New in eGRID
There is one major methodological change to eGRID2014. In this edition, much more effort was
taken to report generator- and unit-level data. In previous editions of eGRID, these data were only
reported in eGRID if they were reported at the generator or unit level in the EPA/CAMD or EIA data.
In eGRID2014, we include the entire universe of generators and units that report to EPA/CAMD and
EIA. Where generator- or unit-level data on generation, emissions, or heat input are available, we
report them in eGRID. For all other generators or units, we distribute generation and heat input to
each generator or unit using prime mover-level data. We use emission factors to estimate emissions
based on heat input (see Table C-1, Table C-2, Table C-3, and Table C-6 in Appendix C).

A key advantage of this approach is that the generation from the Generator file and the emissions and
heat input from the Unit file now sum to equal the plant-level generation, emissions, and heat input.

We have also changed the methodology to calculate grid gross loss. Previous editions of eGRID used
data from EIA and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). The new methodology uses
only data from EIA s State Electricity Profiles. For more information on the new methodology see
Section 3.5.

Another relatively minor methodological change involves the CHP adjustment. In eGRID, the
emissions from CHP units are adjusted to account for only the emissions associated with electricity
generation (rather than the emissions associated with useful thermal output). This is done by
multiplying the emissions of the unit to the ratio of heat input for electric power to the total heat input
for that plant from EIA data. In previous editions of eGRID, for CHP units where EIA reported that
the heat input for electric power was equal to the total plant heat input, we would estimate a ratio that
we could use for the CHP adjustment. However, in discussions with EIA, we have decided that for
those CHP units where heat input for electric power is equal to the total heat input, we will not
perform a CHP adjustment in eGRID2014. We assume that for these units, all heat input is used for
electric power and the units do not generate useful thermal output. The CHP adjustment is performed
for all other CHP units.
 
Methodological changes are detailed more fully in Section 3, the Methodology Section. Previous years 
of eGRID data (2012, 2010, 2009, 2007, 2005, 2004, and 2000-1996) are unchanged with the
release of this edition. Please refer to the corresponding Technical Support Documents issued with
previous editions for methodologies specific to those years of data.

There are also several workbook/spreadsheet formatting changes in eGRID2014, including:

     *Renaming the boiler spreadsheet to the unit spreadsheet to more accurately reflect that the
      spreadsheet contains boilers (e.g. steam turbines) as well as gas turbines, internal combustion
      engines, combined cycle units, and renewable sources of electricity generation (wind, solar
      photovoltaic, and hydroelectric);

     *Removing duplicate EPA and EIA data fields as well as the field for  best  data from the
      boiler spreadsheet, now called the unit spreadsheet as mentioned above. Now, only the  best 
      data are reported along with the data source;

     *Removing the owner and historical sequence ID fields that were reported in the Plant file in
      past versions of eGRID. These fields are available in a separate Excel file.

     *In previous editions of eGRID, the unadjusted heat input for renewable fuels in the Plant file
      (geothermal, nuclear, solar, water, and wind) was set to 0. In the current edition of eGRID, all
      renewable fuel heat input is reported directly from EIA-923 data in the Plant file. It should be
      noted that the emission factors for all pollutants for nuclear, solar, water, and wind are set to
      0 and no emissions data will be reported, even if there is positive heat input. See section
      3.1.1.1 for a discussion of geothermal emissions.

     *In previous editions of eGRID, the ozone season generation and ozone season heat input in
      the Unit and Plant file were reported in eGRID as monthly data if the plant reported monthly
      data to EIA and calculated by multiplying total generation or heat input by 5/12 if the plant
      reported only annual data to EIA. However, since EIA includes a distribution of generation
      and heat input by month for plants that report annual data only, the generation and heat input
      ozone season data in eGRID2014 are reported as the direct EIA monthly data for the months
      of May to September. The 5/12 methodology is no longer used.

     *Renaming the power control area spreadsheet to the balancing authority spreadsheet to reflect
      the terminology used by the EIA and NERC.

     *Adding fields to the eGRID Subregion file that report the nonbaseload generation by fuel
      type and the nonbaseload resource mix.

     *Adding fields to the eGRID Subregion file that report the CH4 and N2O emission rates by fuel
      type.

     *Adding an additional workbook that displays emissions, generation and emission rates in
      metric units.

Next GeoPlan imported the eGRID2014 - PLNT14 excel workbook sheet contained 
in the eGRID2014_Data.xlsx workbook into ArcMap.

The PLNT14 excel workbook sheet contains 8,503 year 2014 records representing 
electricity generation plants. 
 
The PLNT14 excel workbook sheet was then exported from ArcMap as a Database 
table.

Next the newly created PLNT14.DBF was spatially mapped using the LAT and LON 
fields containing decimal degrees to 4 decimal places spatial  information. Records with 
no latitude/longitude information were removed from the data set.

Next the newly created PLNT14.SHP projection was defined as GCS_WGS_1984, 
and then it was reprojected to the FGDL Albers NAD 83 HARN projection.

Next a selection was performed on the State FIPS ID field where it was equal to 12 
(i.e. the State of Florida). Several other power plants that skirted the Florida border 
were also included.  

Next the selection was exported to a new shapefile called EPAEGRID_2017.SHP

Next all of the field information was Upper Cased, and five fields were added;
 - NOTES
 - NUCLEAR
 - DESCRIPT based on PNAME.
 - FGDLAQDATE based on the date the data was downloaded from the Source.

Facilities no longer in operation were designated as (CLOSED) in the DESCRIPT field.
Planned facilities were designated as (PROPOSED) in the DESCRIPT field. 
Information on closed and proposed facilities was obtained via google and from 
the following website: http://www.energyjustice.net/map/searchfacility-basic.php. 

Certain points were moved, see NOTES field for features altered. Facility address 
information from the following website was used to help better locate these facilities 
physical locations: http://www.energyjustice.net/map/searchfacility-basic.php.
